# aut-webpack4-aspnetcore-starter-kit

A starter kit for aurelia-toolbelt using webpack and ASP.NET Core


# How to run the project

1. ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```
2. ```dotnet restore```
3. ```au build```
4. ```dotnet run```

* On my system when I ran ```au run``` the bundling process works, but when hitting the URL in browser I get a message that it waits for bundling and after a while getting the error that you've run ```webpack``` twice. 
Would be great if anyone have the time to look at it.
